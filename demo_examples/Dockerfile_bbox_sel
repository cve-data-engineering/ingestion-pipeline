# Refresh repositories
RUN zypper refresh

# Install a BusyBox version older than the fixed 1.34.1-4.9.1
# For example, if 1.34.1-4.9.0 (or lower) is vulnerable:
RUN zypper install -y busybox=1.34.1-4.9.0

# The container now contains a vulnerable version of BusyBox.
# Add any additional steps or configuration as needed.
